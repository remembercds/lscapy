# About
Learning about networking and performing basic networking tasks can be challenging for beginners to the information technology field. Learning how ping works, how to connect to command line services like ftp and ssh and how to scan for port headers are examples of beginner networking concepts. The project is called lscapy. Inspired by the script lscript, which simplified learning about various wifi hacking techniques and wifi security tools. Lscapy similarly simplifies networking functions like listing your computers network information, scanning ports, interacting with networking services. All this though a command line menu system that is easy to navigate and select different options to perform networking tasks.
